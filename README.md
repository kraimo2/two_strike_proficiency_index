# two_strike_proficiency_index
The statistic I am going to attempt to create is called the Two-Strike Proficiency Index (TSPI). This
measures a hitterâ€™s overall effectiveness when in two strike counts. Being able to perform with
two strikes on you is an indication of many attributes such as plate vision, discipline, and clutch
factor. TSPI is measured on a scaled of 0-1, with 1 meaning a player performs perfectly with a
two-strike count (never strikes out, gets on base, gets a hit, or hits a home run) and a 0 meaning
a player performs worst case scenario (always strikes out, never gets a hit or on base).
